//A student's final grade average is calculated by adding together 50% of the homework average, 30% of the quiz average and 20% of the exam average.
//A student's final grade is calculated  based on the final grade average.  
//If it is 90% or greater, it is an A; 80% or better is a B; 70% or better is a C; 60% or better is a D; and anything less than 60% is an F.
//Once calculated, the program will display the student's name, homework average, quiz average, exam average, final average and final grade.
